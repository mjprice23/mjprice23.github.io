Hej! If you're here you probably already know my name is Mallory and I'm a junior at Georgetown University majoring in computer science but spending Spring 2020 studying abroad in Denmark with DIS Copenhagen. The purpose of this blog is not to become an abroad blogging influencer (trust me, it's a thing), but rather to keep my friends and family updated and engaged with what I'm up to in Europe over the course of this semester. I'm very excited to learn more about Denmark, Europe, computer science, biking, hygge, life, and myself over the next four months. Hope you enjoy my writings - if you have any questions, please reach out as I love hearing from people at home. Hej hej!

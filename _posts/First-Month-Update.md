title: First Month Update

![Me in Aarhus!](/images/post2/orange.jpeg)

Hello world! I’m a month into my Copenhagen experience and I’m thinking that three weeks is a good amount of time in between blog posts. I would rather do fewer but lengthier posts that give me a chance to give a pretty comprehensive update on how this experience is unraveling for me. This is super long, so feel free to read as much or as little as you’d like. Without further ado, here’s what I’ve been up to over the past three weeks.

## Some things I've done
>**Ran up the [Copenhill](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/10/08/big-copenhill-power-plant-ski-slope-copenhagen/), a massive power plant that has an artificial skiing surface on top of it as well as a trail and stairs for hiking.**

>**Spent a Saturday in Malmö, Sweden (a 30 minute train ride away from Copenhagen).**

>**Visited Dyrehaven (Deer Park), a massive forest/park that’s a short train ride away from Cope. It used to be the deer hunting grounds for Danish kings and still is home to many a Bambi. It’s also home to the oldest golf course in Scandinavia so maybe Owen and my dad will get there someday. It was beautiful and wistful and a completely different feel from Copenhagen.**

>**I’ve gone through two bikes due to flat tires (the second one happened on the way to the bar). Let’s hope my current bike is “third time’s the charm” and not “three strikes you’re out.”**

>**Lost one of my nice North Face gloves while walking between classes. This might not seem like a big deal, but when I was little I lost my sock in a grocery store and apparently cried for days. My mom also gave me the gloves for Christmas and they were doing such a good job of keeping my hands cozy so I was very sad. Projection much? Anyway, I was so upset that I immediately ran to class, ordered the exact same pair online from a random Danish outdoor company, and then ran four miles to pick them up from a random parcel distribution site a few days later.**

>**Visited with my visiting host family! If you don’t live in a homestay, you have the option to sign up for a visiting host, a Danish family that you can get together with for a meal or an activity a few times a month. Joan and Peter have been wonderful to spend time with and have been so welcoming to me and two other DIS girls.**

## Some things I'm thinking about

I’ve been going back and forth with how deep this blog should go in terms of my cultural ~~ramblings~~ observations. I’m sure many of you are mainly curious about the logistical details of what I’m doing, seeing cool pictures, and just generally making sure I’m having a good time (I am!). I’ve been struggling with how to best articulate and share what I’m noticing in terms of cultural differences without making gross generalizations or coming across as ignorant, especially to those who have spent much more time traveling in Europe than I have. But the point of studying abroad really isn’t merely to take pretty pictures. I think a huge part of it is to actively engage, emotionally and intellectually, with another culture, no matter how Western/similar it may be to your own. While I’m doing a lot of personal journaling while I’m here, I think there’s definitely value in more publicly sharing what I’m learning as well. So before I start that, a disclaimer: 

* I’ve only been here a month.
* I am by no means an expert in Danish history/culture/politics.
* I’m in a program with only Americans, and there is a ton in terms of Danish culture that I have not and likely will not experience because I am an outsider, looking in. My background as an American gives me a perspective that’s inherently biased and hard to shake or rethink.
* Making generalizations (while necessary) is frankly a tricky endeavour, because there are always exceptions to the rules in both good and bad ways.
* My experiences are mine, and (this goes without saying) ((gonna say it anyway)) I can’t speak for everyone, both here and in the US.

Yeah, I warned you this would be a lot of rambling.

That being said, here goes nothing:

* Lots of people here have no interest in respecting personal space, or just don’t have the same concept of physical personal boundaries. People stand super close to me in line at the grocery store, and so many times I’ve had my arm grabbed by a random person on the street. In DC, that could be a sign you’re in the process of getting mugged, but here it’s probably just someone asking me where the Danish Bank is. Yet I’ve also been told by Danes that if you smile at a random person on the street, they’ll think you’re trying to kill them (?!). I’m used to random weirdos getting too close on the DC Circulator bus and people tapping my shoulder at Trader Joe’s, but not so used to a random, well-dressed older woman almost yank me off my bike to tell me that my professor needs to have our class bike elsewhere. 

* People don't ask "how you are" here while making small talk. In fact, they make very little small talk. But if you think about it, most people in the US don't **really** ask how you are. It's a formality: "What's up?" "How are you?" *no one answers either question, keep walking quickly.* Questions and conversation here is much more intentional. I appreciate this, even if it can come across as being less friendly, because ~~I myself am not that friendly of a person~~ I don't particularly enjoy small talk.

* Copenhagen in particular is super advanced and a trendsetter in terms of its livability and quality of city life ([here’s](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20191112-what-the-nordic-nations-can-teach-us-about-liveable-cities) an article we read for my class about it). The government here has made it a priority to create cities that people actually want to be in and can comfortably move through and live in (Denmark also consistently ranks super high in “happiest country” in spite of its seasonal depression-inducing climate). For example, I just read about [people going crazy about see-saws in Manhattan](https://www.amny.com/news/arts-entertainment/feel-like-a-kid-again-while-bouncing-on-seesaws-along-broadway-this-month/) but that type of thing is common in Copenhagen (remember the sidewalk trampolines?). They believe it’s essential to make public spaces that encourage people to stop and enjoy public life. That being said, it’s challenging to compare it to the US because what works here works in part so well because it’s Scandinavia, and this country is tiny. We talk a lot in computer science about scalablity (that is, can your program adapt to new challenges/increased demand/perform well with huge amounts of data). I'm not convinced Scandinavian successes could be scaled to a place like the US. You couldn’t just pick Copenhagen up, drop it in New York, and expect the same level of success in terms of public health and livability. There's around 5.6 million people living in the entire country of Denmark, and an estimated 8.5 million in NYC alone. As an example of a hot topic here, while I love the pedestrian-priority streets here I am not convinced that eliminating the use of THE CAR is the answer to everything. Biking is great in lots of ways, and my housing also isn’t on a Metro line so I definitely have a different perspective. But while Copenhagen is very safe, biking is decidedly less great when you’re coming home alone late at night and you get a flat tire. Rip.

* Continuing with the idea of scalability: so much of what drives conflict in the US and what shapes other countries’ perspectives on said conflict is the stark division between groups--different political ideologies, different races, different religions, etc. The list goes on. I think it’s worth pointing out that the primary reason those conflicts exist in the first place is because DIFFERENT groups exist and they FREQUENTLY INTERACT. Yeah, it’s true that plenty of places in the US aren’t diverse, and it’s also true that the US has plenty of ugly history in terms of dealing with social and political conflict. And yeah, obviously partisianship does not equal diversity. But it can be super easy in the US to encounter people very different from you, many of whom you disagree with, even if it’s through a secondhand interaction like reading a news story. The conflict is heavy but it’s also a product of the diverse perspectives that keep the US interesting. There’s very much noticeably a lot less diversity here in terms of race, religion, and political views. Would Denmark still be so harmonious if it wasn't as homogeneous and had the levels of diversity that the United States does? Not sure, but definitely thinking about it.

* I get asked for directions and am mistaken for being Danish all the time. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised by that and should take it as a compliment, as I’m white with blondish-brown hair, wear darker clothes, and generally make an effort to blend in, but it’s still interesting that people feel comfortable approaching me here in a way that doesn’t really happen to me in the US. To phrase it another way, my RBF doesn’t seem to work here. Maybe I look friendlier than your average Dane.
Related to that, Americans really like standing out, sometimes in the worst possible ways. One of my friends (hello Anthony) summed it up best when he pointed out that our country doesn’t generally reward people for being subtle and conforming to norms. When you’re abroad, this shows. There is nothing more embarrassing than being with or encountering other Americans who actively choose to be loud and obnoxious in places where it would be very much be to everyone’s benefit to be quiet and blend in.

* On our retreat, our LLC leader was talking about the area we were in and how it was much lower-income compared to the Copenhagen area. I can’t cite the specifics of this, but basically he mentioned how wealthier people paid for addicts and other less societally-smiled-upon people to move away from the Copenhagen area and into the more rural area so they wouldn’t have to deal with them in their neighborhoods. As a result, the area we went to for our retreat has experienced some major challenges. It can’t be denied that Denmark does excellent work in terms of healthcare, livability, taking care of its citizens, and its relatively flat social structure. The gravity and benefits of that can’t be overstated. But I think it’s important to be aware of what might be going on beyond the scenes to get a fuller picture of society here.


* On that note, we’ve learned in Danish class about a thing called Janteloven, a set of ideals that discourage ego and individual achievement and instead prioritizes the equality and good of the group. You can read about it here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante Granted, this is just one document, but it seems to identify an important facet of Danish culture, one that values blending in and discourages aggressive competition. While I know not every (or maybe not even most) Danes buy into this, and plenty of people strive for personal achievement here, the idea in general just doesn’t sit right with me. I had to present a show that I like for my TV class, and I chose Showtime’s Billions because I think it serves as a very *American* antithesis to this, for better or worse. Many Americans could use a loooooong lesson in learning how to blend in and shut up when the time is appropriate, and there are definitely ugly consequences of being self-serving at the expense of society’s overall well-being. But I’m overall proud of my country’s competitive nature and encouragement of individual achievement.

* Children here seem much more independent than American kids. It’s not uncommon for little kids to be walking through the city alone, or see the toddlers helping their parents carry the groceries. Older kids seem more mature and overall are granted a lot more freedom and trust from a young age. Granted, Copenhagen is a lot safer than your average American city, but I think it’s incredibly impressive the culture here is such that kids are raised to be so independent.

* The tap water here is of such good quality that you usually pay for it when you’re at a restaurant. You also pay for public restrooms, which is an issue for me because I’m the type of person who will drop $75 on groceries but won’t spend 75 cents on a bathroom as a matter of stubborn principle.

* My grandpa will be thrilled to hear that the Danes do brunch very well here. Lots of places do these beautiful brunch spreads with a bunch of little plates, and I went to a place that I especially liked because you could customize it with exactly what you wanted (I included a menu for everyone’s benefit). The Danes are also very proud of a Danish cultural concept called hygge, which translates roughly to a sense of coziness/contentedness. It’s difficult to articulate but very important so you can read someone else’s explanation of it here.https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/highlights/hygge/what-hygge So far my (somewhat facetious) reaction to hygge is “that candle is cute, but it’s not going to put a dent in my seasonal depression.” But I must say that when I went to brunch I generally felt so cozy and happy and content that I could feel the hygge vibes. Thank you, poppy seed waffle with apple hibiscus cream, for being the key to my cold heart.

* People are people, no matter where you go. For every angry woman who throws up her hands and yells at me for not being able to give her directions in Danish (maybe don’t ask the American next time?), there’s a kind woman and her daughter who help me carry my broken bike across the bridge in the rain and eagerly ask about my time here in Copenhagen. Just like at home: for every crotchety lady in the Met Market parking lot who yells at me for my broken car being in the way of her and her kombucha purchases (if you know you know), there’s a nice guy who’s willing to take time out of his day to try to help me jumpstart my truck. People are people, and generalizations are tricky.

If you got through all that, thank you. This post has gotten way too long but I’m glad I’m documenting my thoughts now so I can further reflect on them and my evolving perspectives later on in the semester and beyond. I’ve definitely adjusted to my new life here, but there are still moments where everything seems surreal in a disconcerting, out-of-body way. I think that’s an important aspect of being here. It keeps me on my toes and it encourages me to constantly reflect. I’m trying to work on not judging my feelings, and just letting them come and go through high-highs and low-lows. I tend to become complacent at Georgetown, going through the motions until the semester is over and I panic over the fleeting nature of time and the preciousness of college. Here, as Ferris Bueller would say, I’m stopping and looking around more than every once in a while. 

I have a lot to look forward to over the next month: I’m visiting Liz in Dublin, then I have a week off from classes so Rob is coming to Europe for a trip I’m really excited for, after THAT my mom is visiting me, and finally, after all of that, all of my Georgetown roommates as well as Danny Griffin (hey bud!) are all reuniting in Copenhagen. From my home (WA) to my home away from home (Georgetown) to my home away from home away from home (here), I have a lot to be grateful for. Very excited for the whirlwind to come. Until then, stay in touch and take care :)

Love,
Mal

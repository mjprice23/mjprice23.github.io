title: First Month Update

![Me in Aarhus!](/images/post2/orange.jpeg)

Hello world! I’m a month into my Copenhagen experience and I’m thinking that three weeks is a good amount of time in between blog posts. I would rather do fewer but lengthier posts that give me a chance to give a pretty comprehensive update on how this experience is unraveling for me. This is super long, so feel free to read as much or as little as you’d like. Without further ado, here’s what I’ve been up to over the past three weeks.

## Some things I've done
**Ran up the [Copenhill](https://www.dezeen.com/2019/10/08/big-copenhill-power-plant-ski-slope-copenhagen/), a massive power plant that has an artificial skiing surface on top of it as well as a trail and stairs for hiking.**

**Spent a Saturday in Malmö, Sweden (a 30 minute train ride away from Copenhagen).**

**Visited Dyrehaven (Deer Park), a massive forest/park that’s a short train ride away from Cope. It used to be the deer hunting grounds for Danish kings and still is home to many a Bambi. It’s also home to the oldest golf course in Scandinavia so maybe Owen and my dad will get there someday. It was beautiful and wistful and a completely different feel from Copenhagen.**

## Some things I'm noticing

If you got through all that, thank you. This post has gotten way too long but I’m glad I’m documenting my thoughts now so I can further reflect on them and my evolving perspectives later on in the semester and beyond. I’ve definitely adjusted to my new life here, but there are still moments where everything seems surreal in a disconcerting, out-of-body way. I think that’s an important aspect of being here. It keeps me on my toes and it encourages me to constantly reflect. I’m trying to work on not judging my feelings, and just letting them come and go through high-highs and low-lows. I tend to become complacent at Georgetown, going through the motions until the semester is over and I panic over the fleeting nature of time and the preciousness of college. Here, as Ferris Bueller would say, I’m stopping and looking around more than every once in a while. 

I have a lot to look forward to over the next month: I’m visiting Liz in Dublin, then I have a week off from classes so Rob is coming to Europe for a trip I’m really excited for, after THAT my mom is visiting me, and finally, after all of that, all of my Georgetown roommates as well as Danny Griffin (hey bud!) are all reuniting in Copenhagen. From my home (WA) to my home away from home (Georgetown) to my home away from home away from home (here), I have a lot to be grateful for. Very excited for the whirlwind to come. Until then, stay in touch and take care :)

Love,
Mal

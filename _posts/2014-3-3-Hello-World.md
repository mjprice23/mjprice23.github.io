title: First Week Update

![Me at Nyhavn](/images/post1/nyhavnme.jpg)

Hej from Mal in Copenhagen! I have now officially been here for a little over a week--I arrived last Saturday after a seven hour flight from the East Coast. As I explained in my About section, I wanted to make this blog mainly to stay connected with my friends and family back home, not just in terms of the details of what I’m actually doing, but also with how and what I’m feeling and learning during this experience (wow, that was wordy). I also think the blogging platform is a good way to informally share my experiences with all who are interested while still trying my best to stay present during my time here. I’m not exactly sure yet how often I’ll update it or what I’ll be talking about each time, but I thought I would kick it off with an overview of my first week here as well as the practical details of my program. You can subscribe to it by clicking the button below and you should get it sent to your email whenever I make a new post, or you can just check in whenever you feel like it. I’ll try to share it to Facebook as well. 

## What I’m doing:
I’m taking part in the DIS Copenhagen program. DIS is, to put it in their own words, “a non-profit study abroad foundation established in Denmark in 1959, with locations in Copenhagen and Stockholm. DIS provides semester, academic year, and summer programs taught in English, and offers high-impact learning experiences for upper-division undergraduate students from distinguished North American colleges and universities.” Basically, ~1200 American college students come here each semester to take classes in English with other American students at DIS’ campus in central Copenhagen. One of my Georgetown roommates is studying at the Stockholm program (hi Hannah!!). The important distinction is that it’s a study abroad institute, rather than an actual foreign university, so DIS provides a ton of support in terms of the actual study abroad experience. I’m not actually enrolling in another university, but my classes still count towards my degree at Georgetown.

## My classes:
Classes only started on Thursday, so I haven’t actually had all of them yet, but so far so good! I’m taking two computer science classes: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning as well as Computational Analysis of Big Data (you can see why I generally just refer to them as “my CS classes”). I’m also taking Danish Language and Culture, Glued to the Set (it’s about TV culture in the US, UK, and Scandinavia), and Urban Livability (we do a lot of biking!). Neural Networks is my Core Course, which means that I spend two weeks over the course of the semester traveling with the people in it. We go to a different part of Denmark in February and then to London in March (which means I’ll also get to see another one of my roommates while I’m there. Hi Alexa!). Some of the DIS professors are professors at other universities here, but many are just experts in their fields who also happen to teach at DIS. If anyone remembers how much I loved my Italian experience at Georgetown I’m sure you’re delighted to see I’ve found myself in yet another foreign language class, but I really am looking forward to learning more about Danish culture and hopefully relying on Google Translate a little less. I also found out today that my Urban Livability professor has spent time helping design a new bike path from Tacoma to Puyallup, which was an insane small world story of sorts considering how far away I am from home. I also don’t have classes on Fridays--nor have I since semester one at Georgetown ;) --and on Wednesdays everyone in DIS has field trips instead of classes. Overall, a pretty good schedule.

## Living situation
I live in a brand new apartment complex that’s about a 35 minute walk/12 minute bike ride from the campus/center of Copenhagen. It’s on the southern side of the canal, which makes for a pretty commute. I live in an Outdoor LLC, which means I live with a group of other DIS girls and we take part in an outdoorsy activity each week. We do things like winterbathing, ice skating, a retreat, etc. My apartment has six girls, and there are two other apartments in the building with six girls in each as well. My direct roommate here, Arie, goes to George Washington, also in DC. There are a few grocery stores within a couple blocks of my apartment, which is very lucky, although as someone who basically lived within the aisles of Trader Joe’s last semester I really miss my snacks. I can either commute to school using the bus, walking, biking, or a combination. Some of you might know that Copenhagen is a HUGE biking city. It’s by far the most popular mode of transportation here, and the city has been used as a model for livable urban planning in other cities. There are *no* Ubers here, which is a big adjustment for a Georgetown kid. I guess I’m about to (hopefully?) become a very confident cycling commuter.

## Some early observations, notes, and reflections:
The climate here is similar to that of the Pacific Northwest (lotsa rain and it gets dark around 4pm right now). I’ve made a point during this first week to go for a run even when it’s raining for two reasons: if I only explore in sunny weather then I likely will not see very much of Copenhagen at all, and since I’ve already found some really cool places while running in the rain I’ve started associating rainy days with excitement and exploring. Running always makes me feel more settled, both within myself and a new city. It’s how I helped with the adjustment to moving to DC three years ago, and it’s been a great way to kick off my time her in Copenhagen. I found the sidewalk trampolines by myself earlier this week and was *so* excited.

For those wondering, Danish is the language of the land here but most people speak impeccable English and it’s really quite impressive. You feel a little bad expecting people to speak English to you, but we’ve also noticed and been told that many Danes would much rather speak to you in English than have you stumble through indecipherable Danish vocabulary (pronunciations here are very nuanced and the opposite of straightforward).

There are ~45 Georgetown students studying here, but my roommates are all studying elsewhere in Europe (this gives me a chance to shout out my final and direct roommate, who’s studying in Dublin. Hi Liz!!)

What I’ve seen of Copenhagen so far is a beautiful and seamless blend of both old, intricate European architecture and sleek, modern Scandinavian design. Very enchanting, very impressive. 

Learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable will be crucial to my enjoyment and personal development this semester. I have already had Ignorant American™ moments and they aren’t fun but they are inevitable. I have to realize it’s part of understanding yourself a little better in relation to the rest of the world. What do I take for granted? What do other Americans take for granted that so many other cultures couldn’t care less about (i.e. Uber)? What in particular makes me anxious and uncomfortable? How do I cope with that? What brings me joy and who am I when I’m thousands of miles away from home and my home away from home and those I love? What do I want out of the rest of college and out of life in general? Hopefully I can walk away from this semester with a better understanding of these questions and myself.

I think that because I moved so far away for college and it was fairly jarring, at least at first, I expected this transition to be seamless because in a way I've done it before. This in hindsight was naive but also prevented me from worrying about things outside of my control over the past couple months. Abroad is a transition that requires acclimating and adjusting and feeling out of place, sometimes when you least expect it. Even though Copenhagen is not that much of a culture shock coming from the US, it still hit me over the first few days that, wow: I’m in a foreign country and I don’t have Liz (we have been roommates since freshman year) or Rob or lots of my other best friends. I’m going to be here for four whole months, while life at Georgetown goes on without me. Yet I know that that’s entirely the point. When else in my life would I have this opportunity? It’s time to embrace newfound joys and sights and feelings and perspectives while I have the opportunity to do so. Already I’ve transitioned from thinking “I’m here for four whole months!” to “I only have four months!” I intend to make the absolute most of them throughout all the ups and downs I might encounter this semester.

This has been long enough, so I’ll sign off for now. Reach out to me at anytime and wish me luck in my new adventure :)

Love,
Mal
